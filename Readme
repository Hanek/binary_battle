Binary Evolution Game

This piece of software inspired by the Conway's Game of Life.

The field is two-dimensional orthogonal closed grid of cells each 
of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. 

Every alive cell belongs to any of two possible races: black or white.

Evolution occurs using the following simple rules:

- Any live cell with seven live neighbours dies due to overpopulation;
- Any live cell with less then seven live neighbours and with more live         
  neighbours of opposite race then its own, becomes dead due to struggle for survival;
- Any dead cell becomes alive if it has at least one live neighbour and the 
  newborn cell acquire a race of majority, if black neighbours equals white neighbours then cell remains dead;
  
  
The following format accepted for testing patterns:

[field size][number_of_black_cells][number_of_white_cells]
'-' dead cell
'.' white cell
'X' black cell


Based on my observation, there are any kind of possible solutions in this game:
- black wins;
- white wins;
- draw;
- oscillation;
Some solutions require significant amount of generations, say for 17-sized field(stable1.dat) it takes more then 12300000 generations to complete.
